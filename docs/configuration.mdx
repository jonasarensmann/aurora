# Configuration

## Introduction

The configuration is done in the `createServer` method. The configuration is an object with the following properties:

- `port` (number): The port to listen on. Default is `8080`.
- `debug` (boolean): If `true`, the server will show debug information on error Pages. Default is `false`.
- `logging` (table): The logging configuration.
- `logging.enabled` (boolean): If `true`, the server will log requests. Default is `true`.
- `logging.logToFile` (boolean): If `true`, the server will log requests to a file. Default is `false`.
- `logging.logFilePath` (string): The path to the log file. Default is nil.

## Example

```lua
aurora.createServer({
    port = 8080,
    debug = true,
    logging = {
        enabled = true,
        logToFile = false,
        logFilePath = "request.log" -- Paths are relative to the working directory
    }
})
```

## Logging

The server logs requests to the console by default. If you want to log to a file, you can set `logging.logToFile` to `true` and `logging.logFilePath` to the path of the log file.

## Debug

If you set `debug` to `true`, the server will show debug information on error pages. This is useful for development, but you should disable it in production.
