# Routing

- [Basic Routing](#basic-routing)

## Basic Routing

Aurora uses "get", "post", "put", "patch", "delete" methods to register routes.

#### Get

The `get` method is used to register a route that will only respond to HTTP GET requests:

```lua
Aurora.get('/', function(req, res)
    res.send("Hello World")
end)
```

```lua
function get(path: string, handler: (request: Request, resonse: RouteResponse) -> RouteResponse, middleware: { string }?)
```

#### Post

The `post` method is used to register a route that will only respond to HTTP POST requests:

```lua
Aurora.post('/', function(req, res)
    res.send("Hello World")
end)
```

```lua
function post(path: string, handler: (request: Request, resonse: RouteResponse) -> RouteResponse, middleware: { string }?)
```

#### Put

The `put` method is used to register a route that will only respond to HTTP PUT requests:

```lua
Aurora.put('/', function(req, res)
    res.send("Hello World")
end)
```

```lua
function put(path: string, handler: (request: Request, resonse: RouteResponse) -> RouteResponse, middleware: { string }?)
```

#### Patch

The `patch` method is used to register a route that will only respond to HTTP PATCH requests:

```lua
Aurora.patch('/', function(req, res)
    res.send("Hello World")
end)
```

```lua
function patch(path: string, handler: (request: Request, resonse: RouteResponse) -> RouteResponse, middleware: { string }?)
```

#### Delete

The `delete` method is used to register a route that will only respond to HTTP DELETE requests:

```lua
Aurora.delete('/', function(req, res)
    res.send("Hello World")
end)
```

```lua
function delete(path: string, handler: (request: Request, resonse: RouteResponse) -> RouteResponse, middleware: { string }?)
```
