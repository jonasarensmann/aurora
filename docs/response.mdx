# Response

A response object represents the response to a request. It contains the status code, the body of the response, and the headers.

## Properties

- status (number): The status code of the response.
- body (string): The body of the response.
- headers (object): The headers of the response.

## Example

```lua
local aurora = require("aurora")

aurora.get("/", function(request)
    return {
        status = 200,
        body = "Hello, world!",
    }
end)

aurora.createServer()
```

## Response Wrapper

There are some helper functions that can be used to create a response object.

```lua
function sendHtml(html: string, keys: { [string]: string | {any} | number }?, status: number?): Response
```

---

```lua
type Response = {
    status: number,
    body: string,
    headers: { [string]: string }?
}
```
