# Aurora

Aurora is a simple web framework for the [Lune Runtime](https://github.com/lune-org/lune) inspired by [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

### Example

Install Aurora using [Farmer](https://github.com/jonasarensmann/farmer)

```bash
farmer init aurora-example
cd aurora-example
farmer add aurora
```

```lua
local aurora = require("@aurora/")

-- GET request to /
aurora.get("/", function(req, res)
    res.send("Hello World")
end)

aurora.serve() -- runs the server on port 8080
```
