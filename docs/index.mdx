# Aurora

Aurora is a simple web framework for the [Lune Runtime](https://github.com/lune-org/lune) inspired by [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

### Example

```lua
local aurora = require("aurora/main")

aurora.get("/", function(req, res)
    res.send("Hello, World!")
end)

aurora.createServer({
    port = 8080,
    debug = true,
})
```

#### At the moment, html special characters are not escaped automatically. This will be changed in the future.

use `aurora.escapeHtml` to escape html special characters.
